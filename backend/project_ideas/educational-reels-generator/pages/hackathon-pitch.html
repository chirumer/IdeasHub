<h1>Hackathon Pitch</h1>

<h2>Educational Reels Generator</h2>

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>Educational content on YouTube is often lengthy, making it hard for learners to quickly grasp key concepts. Students and professionals want bite-sized, engaging educational content that fits their busy schedules.</p>

<h3>Our Solution</h3>
<p>YouTube gives most watched graph for videos. Maybe we can clip the most watched parts of educational videos, filter it by AI to check if it's engaging. We can make an app for a Hackathon that generates educational and engaging reels.</p>

<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>The user can briefly specify their educational goal in our app. For eg. To learn web development. We will generate a roadmap of topics to learn web development eg. HTML then front-end then backend. And in our app it shows reels related to the roadmap.</p>

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Smart Clipping:</strong> Automatically identifies the most watched parts of educational videos</li>
  <li><strong>AI Filtering:</strong> Ensures clips are both educational and engaging</li>
  <li><strong>Personalized Roadmaps:</strong> Users specify learning goals (e.g., "web development")</li>
  <li><strong>Curated Feed:</strong> Generates a roadmap and serves relevant reels</li>
</ul>

<h3>Use Case Example</h3>
<p>A user wants to learn web development. Our app:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Creates a roadmap: HTML → CSS → JavaScript → Frontend Frameworks → Backend</li>
  <li>Finds top educational videos for each topic</li>
  <li>Identifies the most-watched segments using YouTube analytics</li>
  <li>AI filters these segments for educational value and engagement</li>
  <li>Transforms them into short-form content (reels)</li>
  <li>Serves them in the app following the roadmap sequence</li>
</ol>
