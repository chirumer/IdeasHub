<h1>Hackathon Pitch</h1>

<h2>Chess Coach</h2>

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>There are chess puzzles available online like the ones in <a href="https://lichess.org/training">lichess training</a>. However, often these chess puzzles are unrealistic and are aimed towards building chess tactics.</p>

<p>To be good at chess puzzles does not translate to good chess gameplay as evidenced by discussions in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/chess_puzzles_vs_real_games">chess community forums</a>.</p>

<p>One can only improve their gameplay by practicing chess games and analyzing their faults and good moves.</p>

<p>Chess.com's coach mode helps users analyze their moves from past games with the best possible move. But the coaching is restricted to just the best move.</p>

<p>Although useful, it does not have the same appeal as chess puzzles, which are a gamified way of learning.</p>

<h3>Our Solution</h3>
<p><strong>We propose an AI chess coach that coaches the hobbyist with chess puzzles inspired by their previous games.</strong></p>

<p>Instead of generic tactical puzzles, users get personalized puzzles extracted from their own games. This bridges the gap between puzzle-solving skills and real gameplay improvement.</p>

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Personalized Puzzles:</strong> Automatically generate chess puzzles from your actual games</li>
  <li><strong>Gamified Learning:</strong> Transform post-game analysis into engaging puzzle challenges</li>
  <li><strong>AI-Powered Feedback:</strong> Get detailed explanations of why your moves work or don't work</li>
  <li><strong>Real Game Context:</strong> Learn from positions you actually encountered, not abstract tactics</li>
  <li><strong>Progressive Difficulty:</strong> Adjust puzzle difficulty based on your skill level</li>
  <li><strong>Interactive Coaching:</strong> Ask questions about positions and get AI explanations</li>
</ul>

<h3>How It Works</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Connect your lichess account (or import games from other platforms)</li>
  <li>Our system analyzes your games to identify puzzle-worthy positions</li>
  <li>Puzzles are generated using chess engine analysis</li>
  <li>Solve puzzles and receive AI-generated feedback on your moves</li>
  <li>Learn from your mistakes in a gamified, engaging format</li>
</ol>

<h3>Implementation Form</h3>
<p>We can make the implementation in the form of a gamified post-game analysis chrome extension similar to my "post video quizzer" hackathon idea that won NMIT hackathon (that generated gamified quiz to reinforce concepts explained in a Youtube video, this helps reinforce chess game mistakes in a gamified manner).</p>

<h3>Hackathon Tip</h3>
<p>We don't mention chess.com's coach mode in the pitch (some hackathon judges will say it's too similar), but if asked about it we say how we are different and defend our idea.</p>
